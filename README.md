# Coding Exercises: TypeScript & Svelte Reactivity

This repository contains small, focused exercises for learners practicing modern TypeScript and Svelte 5 reactive statements. The structure is intentionally simple so you can explore the code directly without heavy tooling.

## What’s inside
- **typescript-basics/** — TypeScript exercises tailored for JavaScript developers. Each file includes short explanations and TODOs.
- **svelte-5-reactivity/** — Svelte 5 + TypeScript exercises that focus on `$:` reactive statements, including safe patterns for async side effects.
- Additional language folders (e.g., `rust-basics/`, `python-exercises/`) can be added later following the same layout.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run a lightweight type check for the TypeScript snippets:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```
   These exercises are meant to be read and edited directly; there is no build pipeline.

## Notes on Svelte exercises
The Svelte files are code-only teaching examples. Drop them into a Svelte 5 + TypeScript project if you want to run them. Focus on the comments and TODOs to learn how reactive statements behave and how to handle async side effects safely.
